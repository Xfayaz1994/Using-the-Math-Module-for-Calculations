This is a simple Python program.
It asks the user to enter a number and then uses Python’s math module to find the square root, natural log, and sine of that number.

I wrote this program to practice using:

user input

functions from the math module

basic print statements

Example

If you enter 25, the program will show:

square root of the number

natural logarithm

sine value (in radians)

This is a beginner-level program and helps in understanding how built-in modules work in Python.
